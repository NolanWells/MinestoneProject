Welcome to my Project! After a lot of coding I was finally able to figure out my verision of Frogger! We used alot of different methods to try and get this to work. As you can tell most of my project is in Javasprict and that is what I mostly used. In the Java code I was able to make a collision then with that collision we can have have it be seen with my character causing the game to end! Some other functions that we made creat the cars moving at a random pace between 1 and 3 seconds. Other functions creat the road fit to different broswers sizes. After a lot of hard work the game is finshed! Enjoy!
